The Demiurge

Goal of this project: Deliver an intense action game with an immersive and interactive environment which rewards the player for the difficult moments in the game. The length of the game will be short and sweet with choices that will change the outcome of the story.

This repo is the continuation of my original project titled "ultimate2d". See github.com/anthonyspano/ultimate2d
